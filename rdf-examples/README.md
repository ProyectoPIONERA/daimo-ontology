# Ontology Implementation Examples

This folder contains **examples that demonstrate how to use and instantiate the ontology**.  
These examples illustrate how to create instances (individuals) of the ontology’s classes and how to establish relationships between them.

## 📘 Purpose
The goal of this directory is to provide **practical examples** that help users understand how to apply the ontology in real-world scenarios or datasets.

Typical use cases include:
- Creating individuals that represent real-world entities.  
- Demonstrating how object and data properties connect instances.  
- Providing example datasets for testing or validation.  
- Supporting tutorials or user documentation.

## 📂 Contents
Include here any files that contain example data or instance definitions, such as:

- `.ttl` — Example instances in Turtle format  
- `.rdf` — Example data serialized in RDF/XML  
- `.jsonld` — Example instances in JSON-LD format  
- `.owl` — Example ontologies extending or using the main ontology  

## ⚙️ Best Practices
- Ensure examples are **consistent with the latest version** of the ontology.  
- Include comments or documentation within the files to explain the examples.  
- Use realistic but fictional data to illustrate usage (avoid sensitive information).  
- Reference the ontology namespace clearly in all examples.

## 🗂️ Notes
- This folder is for **examples only** — the ontology definition itself should be stored in the `/implementation` folder.  
- You may organize examples into subfolders by domain or use case (e.g., `/examples/environment/`, `/examples/healthcare/`).
