# Ontology Requirements

This folder contains all the **requirements and supporting materials** used during the development of the ontology.

## 📘 Purpose
The goal of this directory is to store and organize the **foundational information** that guides the ontology’s design and implementation.  
These requirements define **what the ontology should represent**, **why it is being developed**, and **how it should support the intended use cases**.

## 📂 Contents
Include here any documents or resources that describe or justify the ontology requirements, such as:

- **Competency questions** — Questions the ontology must be able to answer.  
- **Use cases and scenarios** — Descriptions of real-world contexts where the ontology will be applied.  
- **Domain requirements** — Lists of key concepts, relationships, or constraints gathered from experts.  
- **Stakeholder requirements** — Functional and non-functional needs from users or organizations.  

## 📄 Accepted Formats
You can use the following formats:
- `.md` — Markdown documents  
- `.docx` / `.pdf` — Formal requirement documents  
- `.csv` / `.xlsx` — Requirement lists or traceability matrices  
- `.txt` — Notes or preliminary requirement drafts  

## ⚙️ Best Practices
- Keep requirements **traceable** — link each one to ontology elements (classes, properties, etc.).  
- Maintain version history as requirements evolve.  
- Ensure consistency between requirements, conceptualization diagrams, and implementation.  
- Review and validate requirements with domain experts before ontology development begins.

## 🗂️ Notes
- This folder is intended for **requirement documentation only** — not for ontology diagrams or implementation files.  
- Use subfolders if needed (e.g., `/competency-questions/`, `/use-cases/`, `/traceability/`).
